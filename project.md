# AR Car Repair Project Details

This project is focused on creating an **Augmented Reality (AR) Car Repair Guide** that helps users with step-by-step instructions for removing and handling car batteries. By leveraging **PlugXR** and **AR technology**, the app overlays detailed instructions and visual guidance over the real-world car battery, making it easier for users to perform the task safely and correctly.

## Project Overview

In this project, an AR mobile application was developed using **PlugXR**, a platform for building AR experiences. The app uses **marker-based AR** technology, where a specific image (the car battery marker) acts as the trigger for the AR scene to appear. Upon scanning the marker, the user can view detailed AR overlays providing guidance on how to remove and handle the car battery.

The key components of the project are:
- **PlugXR Viewer App**: An app used to view AR content.
- **Target Marker**: A custom image that the app recognizes to trigger the AR scene.
- **AR Scene**: An interactive, step-by-step AR guide that provides instructions for battery removal.

## Features Implemented

1. **Marker-Based AR**:  
   The app scans a pre-defined target marker (the car battery image) using the mobile camera. This marker triggers the AR scene to display on the user’s screen.

2. **Step-by-Step AR Guidance**:  
   Once the marker is detected, the app displays AR overlays that guide users through the process of safely removing a car battery. This includes visual cues to help identify tools and steps.

3. **User-Friendly Interface**:  
   The app is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to easily follow the instructions. All AR elements are interactive and dynamically adjust to the user's perspective as they move around the target.

## Work Done

- **App Development**:  
  Developed the AR mobile app using **PlugXR** for marker-based AR functionality. Integrated the **PlugXR Viewer** APK for testing and deployment.

- **Marker Creation**:  
  Created and prepared the **target marker image** representing the car battery. This image acts as a visual cue for the AR system to activate.

- **AR Scene Setup**:  
  Designed and implemented the AR scene, which includes step-by-step visual guides and instructions that overlay onto the car battery marker.

- **Testing and Troubleshooting**:  
  Tested the app and ensured that the AR scene accurately responds to the target marker. Resolved issues related to AR marker detection and optimized the app for smooth functionality.
